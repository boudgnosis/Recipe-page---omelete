### What I learned

Exploring website optimization, I learned about the WebP image format, which offers lower weight and good quality, improving loading speed.

### Continued development

I want to continue deepening in website optimization and improve my skills in responsive design to create more efficient and adaptable websites.

### Useful resources

- [¿Qué es WebP? El formato de imagen de última generación](https://es.siteground.com/kb/que-es-webp/). It helped me to understand the webp format much better.
